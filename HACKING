If you want to hack on the PLib project, you'll need to have the
following packages installed:

	- GNU autoconf 2.54
	- GNU automake 1.7
	- GNU libtool 1.4

Before running autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have libtool
in your path.

For information about submitting patches see the README file.
