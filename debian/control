Description: Highly portable C system library
 plibsys is a cross-platform system C library with some helpful routines. It
 has zero third-party dependencies and uses only native system calls.
 .
 plibsys provides:
 .
 Platform independent data types
 Threads
 Mutexes
 Condition variables
 Read-write locks
 System-wide semaphores
 System-wide shared memory
 Optimized spinlock
 Atomic operations
 Socket support (UDP, TCP, SCTP) with IPv4 and IPv6
 Hash functions: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, GOST (R 34.11-94)
 Binary trees: BST, red-black, AVL
 INI file parser
 High resolution time profiler
 Files and directories
 Shared library loading
 Useful routines for linked lists, strings, hash tables
 Macros for CPU architecture, OS and compiler detection
 Macros for variable arguments
