Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd plib-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -  # unpack the sources
  % cd plib-<version>                           # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                             # run the `configure' script
  % make                                    # build PLib

  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                            # install PLib

Note: if you have downloaded sources using Git, there will be no
configure script, you need to run autogen.sh in PLib's top dir.

Building PLib on Windows
========================
You can build PLib on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (and newer).
See build-aux/win32/vs9 for solution and project files.

Requirements
============

GNU make (http://www.gnu.org/software/make) is recommended.


Installation directories
========================

The location of the installed files is determined by the --prefix
and --exec-prefix options given to configure. There are also more
detailed flags to control individual directories. However, the
use of these flags is not tested.

One particular detail to note, is that the architecture-dependent
include file plibconfig.h is installed in:

  $exec_prefix/lib/plib/include/
